    "The Baltimore Sun conducted an analysis of bridge conditions in Maryland, with a focus on bridges in the Baltimore area. The Sun looked at which bridges were listed in \"poor\" condition by the Federal Highway Administration (FHA) — and in particular, which have been \"poor\" for several years.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results were reported in a October 8, 2018 Baltimore Sun story titled [\"How safe are Maryland's bridges?\"](http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/bs-md-bridge-collapse-maryland-20180815-story.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the key findings of the data analysis, which is documented below and based on data from the FHA’s 2017 and 2007 [National Bridge Inventory](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/bridge/nbi.cfm):\n",
    "\n",
    "- The median age of Maryland's bridges is 46 years.\n",
    "- 288 (5.4 percent) of the bridges in Maryland were classified as being in both \"poor\" and \"structurally deficient\" condition.\n",
    "- 66 (2.6 percent) of the bridges owned or maintained by the State Highway Administration were listed as being in \"poor\" condition.\n",
    "- Baltimore city owns all of the untolled bridges within its boundaries.\n",
    "- 33 (13 percent) of city-owned bridges in Baltimore were listed in \"poor\" condition.\n",
    "- 20 city-owned bridges in Baltimore have been in \"poor\" condition for 10 years or more.\n",
    "- There were 36 bridges listed in “poor” condition in Baltimore County.\n",
    "- 11 bridges in Baltimore County have been in “poor” condition for 10 years or more.\n",
    "- 21 bridges in Harford County were listed in “poor” condition.\n",
    "- 11 bridges in Harford County have been in “poor” condition for 10 years or more.\n",
    "- The State Highway Administration maintains roughly half of Maryland’s more than 5,000 bridges.\n",
    "- The other half of the state’s bridges are owned by up to 15 different types of agencies, including county highway agencies, city or municipal highway agencies, state toll authorities, private owners and others.\n",
    "- There is a bridge owned by NASA — a federal access road in Prince George’s County."
